Typography is key in the restaurant business.

BUT, do we ever really stop to think about what it actually means to the development of a 'fancy' restaurant and its company specifically? Do we ever stop to analyse the type in a menu or in the logo of a restaurant when picking out somewhere to eat?

The answer is no. We simply see something as elegant and sophisticated as a fine-dining menu and trust-fall into our waiter's arms. Because subconsciously, although we may not realise it in the moment, a mastered design and clean typeface is more than enough to build the level of trust necessary to entice a guest.

This page will cover how this has come to be and all the typographic methods used by upscale restaurant brands to achieve success as a company.



## **My choice of logo and banner**

In creating my logo I wanted to incorporate the fact that my website will be discussing that of fancier restaurants, therefore I decided to use the set up you would find at such a place with a plate and cutlery neatly placed around it. I did not want to create something too intricate because as you will find in my articles, the restaurants I will be discussing mostly do not opt for extravagant designs and place more focus on their 'product'. 

The font I used is similar to that used in the menu of popular restaurant Victor's. As I discuss in the article that you will be able to find on my page, the font represents formality and elegance whilst remaining friendly which is exactly what I intend for the message you should take from this website.

My banner on the other hand simply presents a dinner plate at an upscale restaurant which can be implied through the layout of the plate and name tag directly in front of it. When clicking onto my website it is immediately implied that the contents discussed will be about restaurants.

And that is all I want. A simple interpretation of everything that is upscale from the part of you, my reader.
