Typography is key in the restaurant business.

BUT, do we ever really stop to think about what it actually means to the development of a 'fancy' restaurant and its company specifically? Do we ever stop to analyse the type in a menu or in the logo of a restaurant when picking out somewhere to eat?

The answer is no. We simply see something as elegant and sophisticated as a fine-dining menu and trust-fall into our waiter's arms. Because subconsciously, although we may not realise it in the moment, a mastered design and clean typeface is more than enough to build the level of trust necessary to entice a guest.

This page will cover how this has come to be and all the typographic methods used by upscale restaurant brands to achieve success as a company.
