<h2>What do I like to do?</h2>
<p>
  I enjoy spending time with my friends and going out. I especially like visiting restaurants and plan to create a food blog in the future. This is partially why I have created this website.

<h2>Where do I work?</h2>
<p>
  I work at Victor's restaurant in Oxford as a waitress. I think my job makes me more aware of specific design and typography tactics used by brands because I can see its effects in action.</p>

<h2>Where am I from?</h2>
<p>
  I am originally from London but my parents originate from Georgia (we visit every year). I currently live in Oxford. I guess you could say I am quite familiar with different environments.
