Do you ever see a brand and think: What were they thinking with that?Â 

Some companies just check all the boxes, and some not so much. With all respects to Salt Bae and his ability to transform a mere internet meme from 2017 to a multi-million-dollar luxury chain of steak houses, perhaps a different typographic approach to his brand could have been of more benefit.
